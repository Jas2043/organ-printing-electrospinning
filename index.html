            <p>Electrospinning is a technique that uses electric force to produce micro- and nanoscale fibers from polymer solutions. These fibers have high surface-to-volume ratios and tunable porosity, making them ideal for tissue engineering, drug delivery, and other biomedical applications.</p>

            <h3>The Electrospinning Process</h3>
            <img src="https://www.ptglab.com/media/q1mkd45n/es-blog-fig-3-01.png" alt="Electrospinning process diagram" class="process-image">
            <p>The process of electrospinning, namely utilizing electrostatic forces to generate polymer fibers, traces its roots back to the process of electrospraying, in which solid polymer droplets are formed rather than fibers. In fact, a number of processing parameters must be optimized in order to generate fibers as opposed to droplets, and a typical electrospinning apparatus can be used to form fibers, droplets, or a beaded structure depending on the various processing parameters, such as distance between source and collector. In recent work, a greater understanding of processing parameters has led to the formation of fibers with diameters in the range of 100-500 nm, typically referred to as nanofibers. The development of nanofibers has led to resurgence in interest regarding the electrospinning process due to potential applications in filtration, protective clothing, and biological applications such as tissue engineering scaffolds, and drug delivery devices.</p>
            
            <p>A typical electrospinning setup consists of a capillary through which the liquid to be electrospun is forced; a high voltage source with positive or negative polarity, which injects charge into the liquid, and a grounded collector. A syringe pump, gravitational forces, or pressurized gas are typically used to force the liquid through a small-diameter capillary forming a pendant drop at the tip. An electrode from the high voltage source is then immersed in the liquid or can be directly attached to the capillary if a metal needle is used. The voltage source is then turned on and charge is injected into the polymer solution. Increasing the electric field strength causes the repulsive interactions between like charges in the liquid and the attractive forces between the oppositely charged liquid and collector to begin to exert tensile forces on the liquid, elongating the pendant drop at the tip of the capillary. As the electric field strength is increased further a point will be reached at which the electrostatic forces balance out the surface tension of the liquid leading to the development of the Taylor cone. If the applied voltage is increased beyond this point a fiber jet will be ejected from the apex of the cone and be accelerated toward the grounded collector.</p>
            
            <p>While the fiber jet is accelerated through the atmosphere toward the collector it undergoes a chaotic bending instability thereby increasing the transit time and the path length to the collector and aiding in the fiber thinning and solvent evaporation processes. Yarin et al. have suggested that this bending instability is due to repulsive interactions between like charges found in the polymer jet. Doshi and Reneker had hypothesized that charge density increases as the fiber jet thins, dramatically increasing radial charge repulsion which causes the fiber jet to split into a number of smaller fibers when a critical charge density is met. However, in more recent studies high-speed photography has been used to image the unstable zone of the fiber jet, revealing that a whipping instability causes the single fiber to bend and turn rapidly giving the impression that the fiber is splitting.</p>
            
            <p>The solid polymer fibers are then deposited onto a grounded collector. Depending on the application a number of collector configurations can be used, including a stationary plate, rotating mandrel, solvent (e.g. water), etc. Typically the use of a stationary collector will result in the formation of a randomly oriented fiber mat. A rotating collector can be used to generate mats with aligned fibers, with the rotation speed playing an important role in determining the degree of anisotropy. Additionally, Liu and Hsieh found that both the conductivity and the porosity of the collector play an important role in determining the packing density of the collected fibers. Electrospun cellulose acetate fibers were collected using copper mesh, aluminum foil, water, and paper. The authors found that non-conductive collectors yielded a more porous structure. They hypothesized that conductive collectors are able to dissipate the residual charge of the fibers, while non-conductive collectors lack this ability causing the collected fibers to repel each other, thus decreasing the packing density. Additionally the authors found that more porous collectors resulted in a lower fiber packing density. Furthermore, the geometry of the collector can be selected based on the application so as to form either a sheet or a tubular construct from the same electrospinning setup merely by changing the collector. For example, a 2-dimensional copper mesh can be used to form a sheet, while a cylindrical, rotating mandrel can be used to form a tubular scaffold. This ease of use and adaptability is one of the main reasons for electrospinning's renewed popularity.</p>

    <h2>Tissue Engineering Technology</h2>
    <p>Tissue engineering integrates biological components, such as cells and growth factors, with engineering principles and synthetic materials. Substitute tissues can be produced by first seeding human cells onto scaffolds, which may be made from collagen or from a biodegradable polymer. The scaffolds are then incubated in mediums containing growth factors, which stimulate the cells to grow and divide. As cells spread across the scaffold, the substitute tissue is formed. This tissue can be implanted into the human body, with the implanted scaffold eventually being either absorbed or dissolved.</p>

The production of skin substitutes has played an important role in improving the success of skin graft surgeries, especially for complex wounds such as burns. Substitute tissues of the renal system, including urinary bladders and urethras, have also been engineered and transplanted successfully, thereby broadening therapeutic opportunities for complicated renal disorders. Scaffolds and bioartificial tissues are being investigated for their use in the development of functioning bioartificial limbs; the first such limb to be successfully developed—a rat leg with functioning muscles and veins—was reported in 2015.</p>

    <h3>Connection and Application of Electrospinning</h3>
    
    <p class="research-subtitle">Applications of Electrospinning in Tissue Engineering</p>
    <p>Electrospinning has been widely used in tissue engineering for various applications, including vascular, bone, neural, and tendon/ligament tissues. The flexibility in material selection and the ability to control scaffold properties make electrospun scaffolds suitable for different tissue applications (Image 1).</p>
    
    <p class="research-subtitle">Considerations for Electrospun Fibers in Tissue Engineering</p>
    <p>When applying electrospun fibers in tissue engineering, several considerations must be taken into account, such as material choice, fiber orientation, porosity, surface modification, and tissue application. The material must be biocompatible, and the degradation rate should coincide with the rate of new tissue formation (Image 1). Additionally, the fiber orientation can be controlled to enhance cell attachment and tissue regeneration (Image 4).</p>
    
    <p class="research-subtitle">Challenges of Electrospinning in Tissue Engineering</p>
    <p>Despite its potential, electrospinning faces challenges in tissue engineering, including the need to improve mechanical properties, control cell density, and develop 3D structures. The degradation rate must be balanced with tissue formation to ensure the scaffold's mechanical stability (Image 1). Furthermore, achieving precise fiber deposition and developing scaffolds with biological functional factors remain areas for further research (Image 5).</p>
    
    <p>These insights provide a comprehensive overview of how electrospinning is applied in tissue engineering, the considerations necessary for its effective use, and the challenges that need to be addressed to enhance its potential in this field.</p>

            <h2>My Electrospinning Research</h2>
            <p class="research-title">How do the density, tensile properties and thermal conductivity of Soy protein, alginate protein, gelatin, PVA solutions produced through electrospinning compare?</p>
            
            <p class="research-subtitle">Introduction</p>
            <p>Electrospinning, a process of using electrostatic forces to generate polymer fibers, was invented by Anton Formhals in 1934. We can achieve a variety of materials through electrospinning production, including a variety of fibers mat, fiber film and even fiber tubes. Electrospun materials have a wide range of utilities, such as food storage, drug delivery and tissue engineering. A variety of drugs can be loaded into the fibers, enhance dissolution, and released at proper points. The material could also be used in artificial organs, such as artificial heart valves. With the flexibility in the produced materials, electrospun scaffolds have been used in different tissue applications including: vascular, bone, neural, and ligament. Choice of materials, fiber orientation, porosity, mechanical and thermal properties could provide valuable insights to making the application of these materials more feasible.</p>
            <p>In this research, the tensile properties and thermal conductivity of electrospun fibers will be evaluated using a tensile test stand and thermal couples respectively. The result of this research will indicate which kind of material is the most similar to an actual heart valve, which could provide a new aspect of making artificial organs thus accelerating new discoveries.</p>
